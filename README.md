### LoRaWAN Overview

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a networking protocol specially designed for low power, wide area applications. Introduced in the mid-2010s, LoRaWAN is known for its lower power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and longer range compared to traditional WiFi and cellular communications. However, it features lower bandwidth, which restricts its use for high data transfer applications. This makes LoRaWAN particularly well-suited for agricultural environments, where its ability to operate over long distances without frequent battery recharges enhances its utility for both asset tracking and emergency communication across vast farmlands.

### Problem Overview

The agricultural sector is recognized as one of the most hazardous industries in the United States, with a notable fatality rate of 23.5 per 100,000 workers. Two primary challenges complicate safety measures in this sector:

1. Asset Management: The extensive use of equipment and vast expanses of farmland make it difficult to monitor and manage assets effectively. Loss and misplacement of equipment are common issues, often highlighted during inventory checks.

2. Connectivity and Safety: Unreliable Wi-Fi and cellular connections in rural areas severely impact the implementation of safety measures. This connectivity gap poses a significant risk to worker safety, potentially leaving individuals isolated and unable to call for help during emergencies.

### LoRaWAN as a Solution

Given the limitations of conventional wireless communications like cellular and WiFi—namely their high cost and inadequate coverage in rural settings—LoRaWAN presents a viable alternative. Its low-cost, long-range capabilities allow for communication up to 16 km in open conditions, addressing critical issues within the agricultural industry. By integrating LoRaWAN gateways and developing end-node devices that geolocate and monitor agricultural assets, farms can enhance security against theft and improve safety conditions for workers. These devices not only help in tracking equipment but also enable quick response in medical emergencies, mitigating the risks associated with poor connectivity.
